4) Create a script that takes in a path as an argument, the script then executes the command “ls -la” on that path.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided an argument (path)
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Path argument is missing."
    echo "Usage: ./custom_ls.sh <path>"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract the path argument from the command line
path="$1"

# Check if the specified path exists
if [ ! -e "$path" ]; then
    echo "Error: Path '$path' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

# Execute the 'ls -la' command on the specified path
ls -la "$path"


enter the path which it needs to fetch the ls -la command.

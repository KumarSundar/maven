1) Create a script that creates 30 text files, and write the loop's iteration number into each file as text (Ex: 1.txt contains "1").

for i in {1..30}; do touch $i.txt; done  -> Only to create text files.

#!/bin/bash

# Specify the directory where the files will be created
directory="./task1"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$directory"

# Loop to create and write to each text file
for i in {1..30}; do
    filename="$directory/$i.txt";
    echo "$i" > "$filename"
    echo "Created file: $filename"
done

echo "All text files created successfully."

Any one

for i in {1..30} ; do touch $i.txt; echo $i > $i.txt ; done
